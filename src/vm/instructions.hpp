/** \namespace Instructions
 * \brief All instructions and their opcodes.
 * 
 * Opcodes are declared as the name of the instruction with \c _OP appended.
 * 
 * \note
 * Int8, Int16 and IEEE754binary32 parameters are read from the byte(s) following the opcode.
 * Address, Number, Tuple and Data parameters are taken from the execution stack.
 * %Stack parameters should be pushed in the same order as they are listed in this documentation.
 * 
 * \note
 * The return value (if any) is pushed on the execution stack.
 * If a mathematical formula is given in the documentation as return value, it is (obviously) a Number.
 * In all other cases, the return type is explicitly described.
