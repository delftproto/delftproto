 * One of the types that can be stored in Data.

 * \note This is just a wrapper for an Int8 constant pointer, with an explicit constructor.
 *       This is useful, because \c 0 cannot be interpreted as an Address (unlike <tt>Int8 *</tt>),
 *       you have to explicitly say <tt>Address(0)</tt>.
 *       This makes something like \code Data d = 0; \endcode unambiguous.
 *       (It's interpreted as a Number, not an Address.)
